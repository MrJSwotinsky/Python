### Introduction to Booleans

**AIMS:** <br>
What are booleans and in what ways are the represented in Python?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS63T.1</ins>: Describe the characteristics of Python as a programming language.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can identify boolean values.
- [ ] I can identify relational operators and the ways in which they are used to represent boolean values in different ways.
- [ ] I can explain the impact of performing mathematical operations with boolean values.
- [ ] I can write some basic code to determine the data type of given data.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    1) Create a new IDLE file titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Notes_Booleans.py`<br>
    2) If you are unable to open your IDLE, open the OpenEDG sandbox, <b>and be prepared to send yourself your code at the end of class.**</b><br>
    3) If your code environment is open and you are ready to code, help others in your general area.<br>
  </tr>

**AGENDA:**
1. Quick Note About Representing Large Ints
2. Code-a-long.
     * The Boolean Type.
     * Alternate Methods for Representing Booleans. (Relational Operators)
     * Boolean Math
     * Checking Data Types
3. Homework Head Start

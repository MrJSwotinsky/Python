Due: Wednesday, October 2nd 2024

1. Create a new markdown file in your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Written Responses folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_U1_WR2_Introduction_to_Booleans.md`.
2. Respond to the following prompts:
    * How many different boolean values are there?  What are they?
    * For each boolean value, provide at least two different ways to represent it.
    * The following line of code displays the int `2`.  Explain why.
      ```python
      print(True + True)
      ```
    * The following line of code results in an error.  Explain why.
      ```python
      print(True / False)
      ```
    * Identify whether or not each of the following values are boolean values.  For each value that is not boolean,  explain why not.
        * 'True'
        * 'true'
        *  True
        *  true
        *  'False'
        *  'false'
        *  False
        *  false
        *  1
        *  0
        *  4 = 5
        *  4 == 5
        *  4 = 4
        *  4 == 4
    * In Python, what notation can be used to display the value 999999 in a more visible manner?
    * Write a line of code to display the data type of any data (i.e. How could you display the data type of 15, -1.5, "Hello, World!", True, etc.?)
      
*Hint: To display a line of code in markdown, start with three backticks (Not quotes - The backtick key is to the left of the 1 on most keyboard) followed by the name of the language, and end with three backticks*

*For example, to display this code:*
```python
  print('Hello, World!)
```

*Type this code in markdown:*
````markdown
  ```python
  print('Hello, World!)
  ```
````
3.  After you have responded to all prompts, commit your work.  **Remember to include an appropriate heading and commit message.**

# Unit 1, Assignment 3: Heirarchy of Operations
Due: Tuesday, October 1st 2024

**Complete the following in your notes (Remember to include an appropriate heading on all pages):**

1. Respond to the following questions:
    * Explain what the `**` operator is.  Which data types can it be applied, and in which order?
    * Explain what the `%` operator is.  Which data types can it be applied to, and in which order? 
2. Simplify the following expressions in your notes. Be precise in relation to data types (i.e. int vs. float).  If any expressions will generate an error, explain why.  **Show all work!**
    * `10 - 3 ** 1 * 2`
    * `8 // 4 * 2`
    * `5 + 6 / 3`
    * `3 / (1 // 2)`
    * `11 // 3 % 2`
    * `14 % 3 ** 2`
3. Simplify the following expressions in your notes. **Show all work!**
   * `0 % 2`
   * `1 % 2`
   * `2 % 2`
   * `3 % 2`
   * `4 % 2`
   * `5 % 2`
   * `6 % 2`
   * `7 % 2`
   * `8 % 2`
4. Make a conjecture...based on your work above, describe how to determine the result of any integer mod 2.

After you have completed this assignment, scan your work to a single PDF titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Heirarchy_of_Operations.pdf` and save it in your Physical Device > Python Portfolio > Code Tracing folder.  Then upload it to your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Code Tracing folder.  **Remember to include an appropriate commit message.**

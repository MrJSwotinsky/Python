3. Use a `print()` command that includes spaces to display the following:
```
Hello,    World!
```

4. Use a `print()` command that does not include any spaces to display the following:
```
Hello,    World!
```

5. Use a single `print()` command to display the following statement using escape characters:
```
My name is 'Python'.

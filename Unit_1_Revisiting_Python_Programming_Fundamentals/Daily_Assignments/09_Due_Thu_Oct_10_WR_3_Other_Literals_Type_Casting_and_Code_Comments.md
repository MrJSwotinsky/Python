# Unit 1, Assignment 9: Written Response 3 - Other Literals, Type Casting, and Code Comments
Due: Thursday, October 10th 2024

1. Create a new markdown file in your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Written Responses folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_U1_WR3_Other_Literals_Type_Casting_Comments.md`.
2. Respond to the following prompts:
    * Convert your birthday to a six digit decimal number.  For example, if your birthday is January 1st 2008, the decimal number version of your birthday is 010108.  What is the decimal number version of your birthday?
    * What is the binary version of your number? ([Click here for help](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html))
    * How is the binary version of your number represented in Python?
    * If you use the `print()` function to display this number, what will you see in the console?
    * What does this tell you about using binary numbers as an argument in the print function?
    * What is the octal version of your number? ([Click here for help](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html))
    * How is the octal version of your number represented in Python?
    * If you use the `print()` function to display this number, what will you see in the console?
    * What does this tell you about using octal numbers as an argument in the print function?
    * What is the hexadecimal version of your number? ([Click here for help](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html))
    * How is the hexadecimal version of your number represented in Python?
    * If you use the `print()` function to display this number, what will you see in the console?
    * What does this tell you about using hexadecimal numbers as an argument in the print function?

For the following prompts, you will be asked to write some code.
*Hint: To display code in markdown, start with three backticks (Not quotes - The backtick key is to the left of the 1 on most keyboard) followed by the name of the language, and end with three backticks*

*For example, to display this code:*
```python
  print('Hello, World!)
```

*Type this code in markdown:*
````markdown
  ```python
  print('Hello, World!)
  ```
````
* Respond to the following prompts:
  * Write a line of code to convert the int, `10` to a string.
  * Above your line of code, write an appropriate code comment.
  * Write a line of code to convert the string, `'10'` to a float.
  * At the end of your line of code, write an appropriate code comment.

  * Describe what will happen if you try to convert a float to an int.
  * Describe what will happen if you try to convert a non-numeric string (e.g.`'Hello'`) to an int.
  * Describe what will happen if you place a comment at the beginning of a line of code rather than above or at the end of a line of code.
        
3.  After you have responded to all prompts, commit your work.  **Remember to include an appropriate heading and commit message.**

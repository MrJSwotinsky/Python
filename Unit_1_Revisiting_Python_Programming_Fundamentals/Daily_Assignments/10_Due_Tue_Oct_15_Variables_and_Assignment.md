# Unit 1, Assignment 10: Variables and Assignment
Due: Tuesday, October 15th 2024

**Complete the following in your notes (Remember to include an appropriate heading on all pages):**

For each code snippet below, use code tracing to determine the output.  If executing the code snippet will result in an error, explain why.<br><br>  **Show all code tracing work!**

1.
```python
x = 8
y = 3
x = x % y
y = y % x
print(x + y)
```

2.
```python
x = 8
y = 2
x = x % y
y = y % x
print(x + y)
```

3.
```python
a = 5
b = 2
c = 5 % 2
print(C)
```

4.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(num_1)
```

5.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(num_1 + num_2)
```

6.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(int(num_1) + num_2)
```

7.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(num_1 + str(num_2))
```

8.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(int(num_1) + str(num_2))
```

9.
```python
num_1 = '4'
num_2 = 3
num_1 = num_2 * num_1
print(int(num_1) + str(num_2))
```

```python
val_1 = 12
val_2 = 5
val_3 = val_1 // val_2
val_1 = val_1 / 6
val_2 = 6 - val_2
val_3 = val_1 ** val_2 ** val_3
print(val_1, val_2, val_3, end = 0)
```

After you have completed this assignment, scan your work to a single PDF titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Variables_and_Assignment.pdf` and save it in your Physical Device > Python Portfolio > Code Tracing folder.  Then upload it to your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Code Tracing folder.  **Remember to include an appropriate commit message.**

# Unit 1, Assignment 11: Lab 4 - The input() Function
Due: Wednesday, October 16th 2024

For this lab, you will create a basic chat bot.

Create a new python file in your Physical Device > Python Portfolio > Labs folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_U1_Lab4_Chat_Bot.py`, and complete the following lab:

**Requirements:**

1.  Start by having your chat bot greet the user and introduce itself.
2.  Next, have your chat bot prompt the user to enter their name, accept their name as input, and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
3.  Next, have your chat bot greet the user by name.
4.  Proceed to have your chat bot engage in a short conversation with the user during which it incorporates what the user says in its responses.  For example, if your chat bot prompts the user to enter their favorite color, and the user enters `'blue'`, your chat bot might respond by saying, `'Blue is a very nice color! My favorite color is green.'`


**Additional Requirements:**

5.  Your chat bot must prompt the user at least five times.
6.  At least one prompt must require the user to enter a number.
7.  Your chat bot must perform at least one mathematical operation with the number entered by the user.
8.  Use comments to respond to the following prompts:
     * In the following line of code, identify the argument:
     ```python
     fav_color = input('What is your favorite color?')
    ```
     * What role does the argument play in the `input()` function?
     * In the line of code above, identify the variable.
     * Why is it important to assign data that a user has input to a variable?



After you have completed this lab, upload your work to your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Labs folder. Remember to include an appropriate heading, appropriate comments, and commit message.

## Directions
Complete each of the following exercises.  

As you work through each exercise, upload and commit your work frequently.  This will demonstrate your engagement in the iterative development process and help to verify the authenticity of your work.

For each exercise...
* Remember to include appropriate comments.
* Run, test, and revise your code for each exercise as needed.
* After you have confirmed that your code works, use docstring notation to "comment" it out so that you can move on to the next exercise.

## Exercises
1. Write some code that assigns a secret password to a variable, prompts the user to guess the passpword, and replies to the user to tell them whether or not they guessed correctly.

2. Write some code that prompts the user to input an integer number, and replies to the user to tell them whether the number they entered is even or odd.

3. Write some code that prompts the user to input an integer number, and replies to the user to tell them whether the number they entered is positive, negative, or zero.

4. Write some code that prompts the user to enter a grade between 0 and 100, and replies to tell them their letter grade using the following scale:<br><br>90 - 100: A<br>80 - 89: B<br>70 - 79: C<br>60 - 69: D<br>Below 60: F<br>

5. Write some code that prompts two different users to enter their birthdates, and replies to tell them which user is older.  If both users have identical birthdates, the users should be notified that they are the exact same age.

6. Write some code that prompts two different users to play one round of Rock-Paper-Scissors and replies to tell them which user wins.  If both users select the same object, the users should be notified that they have tied.

After you have completed this lab, upload your work to your GitHub > Python Portfolio > Labs folder.  **Remember to include an appropriate heading, appropriate comments, and an appropriate commit message.**

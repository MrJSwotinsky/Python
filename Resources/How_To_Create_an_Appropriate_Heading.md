# How To...Create an Appropriate Heading

### At minimum, a heading should include:
* Your full name.
* The assignment name.
* The date.

**Use markdown to professionally format your heading.**

For example, an appropriate heading for your first written response might look like...

<br>

> ## A. Student - Written Response - Languages and How Computer Programs Work
> Tuesday, September 10th 2024

<br>

The markdown code to create this heading would look like...

```markdown
## A. Student - Written Response - Languages and How Computer Programs Work
Tuesday, September 10th 2024
```

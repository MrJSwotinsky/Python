### Kahoot Review for Unit 3 Exam (Data Collections)

**AIM:** What key understandings, knowledge, skills, and practices do we need to master to show what we know about lists, tuples, and dictionaries on tomorrow's unit exam?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.3</ins>: Write and analyze programs and code segments in relation to control flow.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.4</ins>: Write and analyze programs and code segments in relation to data collections.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I am able to describe characteristics of lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- [ ] I am able to accurately analyze code segments that involve lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

**AGENDA:**

1. Join Kahoot!
2. Show what you know!
    *  Be prepared to justify your reasoning.
    *  Be prepared to engage in small group discussions.
    *  Key Concepts:
        * Lists:
            * Syntax
            * Referencing Elements 
            * Slices
            * Negative indices
            * Out of range exceptions
            * Copies vs. Pointers
            * `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.insert()`, and `del`
        * Tuples:
            * Syntax
            * Characteristics (e.g. tuples are immutable)
            * Iteration with tuples
        * Dictionaries:
            * Syntax
            * Key-value pairs
            * Iteration with dictionaries
3. Summary / Close:
    * Final Questions / Comments
    * Final Reflection Questions (based on live data)
   
**HOMEWORK:** <br>
Leverage your resources (OpenEDG, Code Analysis Practice Sets, Notes, **a study group session with your debugging buddies**, etc.) to prepare for tomorrow's Unit Exam.

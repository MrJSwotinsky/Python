4. For every question you answered incorrectly, write a short reflection.  To write each reflection...
   * Review your resources (e.g. feedback from AP Classroom, AP daily videos, your own notes, any other resources you have been created or been provided) and consult with your colleagues to make sense of your mistake.
   * Copy/Paste the question prompt.
   * Explain your error.

     For example, a reflection might look like...
  
     > ### What is true about computers?
     > I originally selected the first and last options ("A computer can execute complex operations.  Therefore, it can perform complex tasks." and "A computer can execute complex operations very quickly, virutally any number of times.") because I was thinking about the many complex things computers can do.  However, I forgot to take into account the difference between tasks and operations.  Specifically, even though computers can perform complex **tasks**, they can only perform basic **operations**, and that the way in which they perform complex tasks is by performing a series of basic operations very quickly virtually any number of times.

      ***Note**: If you answered every question correctly, submit a reflection for one question identifying an error someone might make and explaining that error.*

5.  After you have completed all reflections, click the green "Commit Changes" button in the top right corner of the screen.
6.  Type a short, but descriptive, commit message (e.g. "Completed all reflections for Unit 0 Checkpoint 1.")
7.  Click the green "Commit Changes" button.

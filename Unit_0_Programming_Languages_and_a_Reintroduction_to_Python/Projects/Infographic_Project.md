# Unit 0, Project 1: Infographic Project
Due: Wednesday, September 27th 2024

### In this project you will apply what you have learned abouthow a computer works, languages, compilation vs. interpretation, python history/goals/applications/features/drawbacks/implementations, development environments, and errors/debugging to create an infographic that others can use to learn about programming languages, in particular, Python.

## Requirements

1. Your infographic must address the following topics:
* How a Computer Works
* Natural Languages, Programming Languages, and Machine Languages
* Compilation vs. Interpretation
* Python History, Goals, Applications, Features, and Drawbacks
* Python Implemenations
* Development Environments
* Errors and Debugging.

2.

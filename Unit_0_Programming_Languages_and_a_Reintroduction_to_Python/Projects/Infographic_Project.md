# Unit 0, Project 1: Infographic Project
Due: Wednesday, September 27th 2024

### In this project, you will apply what you have learned about how a computer works, languages, compilation vs. interpretation, python history/goals/applications/features/drawbacks/implementations, development environments, and errors/debugging by creating a digital infographic that others can use to learn about programming languages, in particular, Python.

## Requirements

**1. Your digital infographic must address the following topics:**
* How a Computer Works.
* Languages.
* Compilation vs. Interpretation.
* Python History, Goals, Applications, Features, and Drawbacks.
* Python Implemenations.
* Development Environments.
* Errors and Debugging.

**2. Your digital infographic must address each topic in depth.** <br> For example, the section on Languages should not only list parts of a language, types of languages, etc.  It should also describe each part of a language, each type of language, highlight how different types of languages relate to each other, etc.  Your goal in ccompleting this project is to create an infographic that not only serves as a reference tool for yourself, but also as a learning tool for those who follow in your footsteps.

**3.  Your digital infographic should have a professional, visually appealing appearance.**

**4.  Once you have completed your digital infographic, save it as a PDF and upload it to a new folder, titled `Infographic Project` in your GitHub Portfolio.**

**5. Reflect On Your Work**

Upload a written reflection to your infographic project folder on GitHub that includes 5 paragraphs to address the following prompts:

* In your own words, describe this project, its purpose, and what it meant to you.
* In what ways did this project contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major.
* How did you iteratively develop your work on this project over time? (Include specific examples.)
* Looking back, what might you have done differently?
* If you were given the opportunity to further develop your work on this project, what would your next steps be?

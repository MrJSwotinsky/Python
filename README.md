**Prerequisite:** AP Computer Science Principles 1 and 2

**Course Description:** <br><br>Python 1 (Fall Semester) is a semester-long course that serves as the 5th of 8 Computer Science courses required for the CTE Computer Science pathway at Inwood Early College. In this course, you will have the opportunity to expand the skill set you built in AP Computer Science Principles as you work toward developing mastery of the Python programming language. Through a variety of tasks, you will learn about how Python fits in to a diverse and growing set of programming languages. You will also learn about Python’s logic and structure, literals, variables, data types, operators, input/output, control flow, data collections, functions, and exception handling. Successful completion of this course will prepare you for deeper study of programming in Python. This course is also designed to prepare you for the PCEP exam through which you will have the opportunity to earn an industry-recognized credential in entry-level Python programming.<br><br>Python 2 (Spring Semester) is a semester-long course that serves as the 6th of 8 Computer Science courses required for the CTE Computer Science pathway at Inwood Early College. In this course, you will have the opportunity to deepen the skill set you built in Python 1 as you work explore and work toward developing mastery of deeper level programming concepts in the Python programming language.
